## Prompt 2: The Trust Killer (Lesson)
**Hook:** "You're killing trust in the first 30 seconds of your sales call. Here's how..."

**CTA:** "Drop a 🌱 if you've ever opened a call the wrong way."

**Content:** Reveal a powerful discovery question from The Bridge Model: "What would success look like for you six months from now if we worked together?" Explain why this question shifts the conversation from features to outcomes, and gets prospects emotionally invested in the solution.

**Lesson:** "The Explore stage isn't about interrogating—it's about understanding their future vision."

**CTA:** "Try this question on your next discovery call and tell me what happens."

---

## Prompt 5: My First Sales Failure (Story)
**Hook:** "My first major sales presentation was a complete disaster. I thought I nailed it... until I didn't."

**Content:** Share a vulnerable, relatable story about a time early in your career when you thought you delivered the perfect pitch, but the prospect said no. Walk through what you learned: you focused on what YOU wanted to say instead of what THEY needed to hear.

**Lesson:** "The 'Deliver' stage is only effective if you've done the work in Explore. You can't deliver a solution if you don't truly understand the problem."

**CTA:** "Drop your biggest sales lesson learned the hard way in the comments."

## Prompt 6: The Sustain Stage Everyone Ignores (Lesson)
**Hook:** "Most salespeople celebrate the close and then disappear. That's why they struggle with referrals and repeat business."

**Content:** Explain the importance of the "Sustain" stage in SEEDS. Show how following up, checking in, asking for feedback, and staying top of mind leads to referrals, upsells, and long-term relationships. Give 3 quick tips: send a thank-you note within 24 hours, schedule a 30-day check-in, and ask for feedback at 90 days.

**Lesson:** "The sale isn't the end—it's the beginning of a relationship. That's how you build a sustainable business."

## Prompt 7: When a Prospect Says 'I Need to Think About It' (Scenario)
**Hook:** "If you hear 'I need to think about it,' you've already lost the sale. Here's why..."

**Content:** Break down what this objection really means: you didn't uncover the real objections during the Explore stage. Walk through how to prevent this by using The Bridge Model to dig deeper during discovery, address concerns in real-time, and create urgency naturally.

**Lesson:** "Objections at the end mean you didn't ask the right questions at the beginning."

**CTA:** "What's the toughest objection you face? Let me know and I'll make a video on it."

## Prompt 8: The Strategize Hack Top Performers Use (Lesson)
**Hook:** "Top-performing salespeople spend 30 minutes doing this before every sales call. Most reps skip it entirely."

**Content:** Reveal the research and prep process: LinkedIn stalking (professionally), reviewing company news, understanding their industry challenges, identifying mutual connections, and creating a hypothesis about their pain points. Show how this prep allows you to Engage with confidence and Explore with precision.

**Lesson:** "Strategize isn't optional. It's what separates good salespeople from great ones."

**CTA:** "Tag someone who needs to hear this."

**Content:** Tell a story about observing a salesperson who had done everything right—great Strategize, solid Engage, excellent Explore—but then completely bombed the Deliver stage by launching into a generic pitch deck instead of customizing the presentation based on what they learned. The prospect checked out immediately.

**Lesson:** "Your Deliver stage should feel like a conversation, not a presentation. Speak to THEIR pain points, THEIR goals, THEIR language."

**CTA:** "Have you ever bombed a pitch? Share your story—we've all been there."

## Prompt 10: The Growth Mindset Behind SEEDS (Inspirational)
**Hook:** "Growth isn't accidental. It's cultivated. Here's what that actually means..."

**Content:** Share the philosophy behind the SEEDS Method—that sustainable sales success isn't about luck, hustle, or manipulation. It's about planting the right seeds (Strategize), nurturing relationships (Engage + Explore), harvesting results (Deliver), and continuing to cultivate (Sustain). This is agriculture, not alchemy.

**Lesson:** "Sales is a long game. You can't plant seeds today and expect a harvest tomorrow. Trust the process, stay consistent, and watch your garden grow."

**CTA:** "Double-tap if you believe in cultivated growth over shortcuts."
