**Follow-Up (Based on Response):**
```
[If A - Time Management]
I hear you! Prospecting feels like it takes forever.

The 5x5 system actually saves time by:

• Using templates (but personalizing)
• Focusing on high-value channels

Want help setting up a system that works for YOUR schedule? Let's talk: [CALENDAR LINK]

[If B - Messaging]
Great news - the planner includes proven scripts and templates!

But if you want help customizing them for your specific audience, I offer training on prospecting. Check it out: [TRAINING LINK]

[If C - Rejection]
Rejection is tough! Here's the truth: The 5x5 Rule helps because it focuses on activity, not outcomes.

You can't control whether someone says yes. You CAN control making 25 touches per week.

Want to talk about building prospecting confidence? I'm here: [CALENDAR LINK]

Response rates are all about messaging + timing + persistence.

**When:** Someone comments "PIPELINE" on any post

**Automated Response (Message 1):**
```
Hey [First Name]! 📊

Pipeline health is critical! Sending your checklist now.

Pipeline Health Checklist: [LINK TO PDF]

Use this to diagnose:
✅ Is your pipeline full enough?
✅ Are deals moving or stuck?
✅ What's your conversion rate?
✅ Where are deals falling through?

Quick poll: How would you rate your pipeline right now?
A) Empty or inconsistent
B) Decent but unpredictable
C) Full and healthy

Reply with your letter!
```

**Follow-Up (Based on Response):**
```
[If A - Empty]
I hear you. An empty pipeline is stressful!

The good news: This is fixable with the right system.

Here's what you need:
1️⃣ The 5x5 Prospecting Rule (comment PROSPECT for that)
2️⃣ A consistent daily routine
3️⃣ Activity tracking

Want help building a system that fills your pipeline predictably? Let's talk: [CALENDAR LINK]

[If B - Decent but unpredictable]
"Decent but unpredictable" is the #1 complaint I hear!

Usually this means:
• Prospecting isn't consistent enough
• Qualification needs work
• Follow-up system needs strengthening

I can help you diagnose exactly what's causing the unpredictability. Book a call: [CALENDAR LINK]

[If C - Full and healthy]
That's awesome! 🎉

If your pipeline is full and healthy, you're probably ready for the next level:

Hey [First Name]! 🎯

Buyer avatars are so powerful! Sending your worksheet now.

This covers the 4 Pillars:
1️⃣ Demographics (the basics)
2️⃣ Psychographics (how they think)
3️⃣ Motivations (why they buy)
4️⃣ Buying Triggers (when they act)

Most people stop at demographics. Big mistake!

The magic is in pillars 2-4.

Have you created a buyer avatar before, or is this your first time?
```

**Follow-Up (If They Respond):**
```
[If First Time]
Exciting! This is going to change how you approach sales.

Take your time filling it out - the more specific, the better.

If you want help creating your avatar (or validating it), I offer strategy sessions: [CALENDAR LINK]

Great! Then you know how valuable this is.

This worksheet goes deeper than most - especially on psychographics and buying triggers.

```

**Follow-Up (If They Respond):**
```
Ah yes, "[their objection]" - that's a common one!

The guide has several responses for that. Try a few and see what resonates.

Pro tip: Most objections are actually questions in disguise. They're asking for more information, not saying no.

### Trigger: RETENTION
**When:** Someone comments "RETENTION" on any post

Hey [First Name]! 🔄

Smart focus! Retention is 5x more profitable than acquisition.

Customer Retention Playbook: [LINK TO PDF]

This playbook includes:
✅ 90-day onboarding plan
✅ Proactive communication calendar
✅ Upsell conversation frameworks
✅ Referral request scripts
✅ Retention metrics to track

Question: Do you currently have a formal retention/customer success process?
```

**Follow-Up (Based on Response):**
```
[If NO]
No worries - most people don't!

But here's the thing: A little bit of retention effort goes a LONG way.

Start with the 90-day onboarding plan in the playbook. That alone will transform your customer experience.

If you want help building a complete retention system, let's talk: [CALENDAR LINK]

[If YES]
That's great! Then you know how important this is.

## Follow-Up Sequence Strategy

### General Follow-Up Timeline

**Immediate (0-5 minutes):**
- Automated trigger response delivered

**Day 1 (If they respond):**
- Automated qualifying question follow-up
- OR human takeover if complex question

**Day 2 (If no response):**
- Automated check-in message
- "Did you get a chance to check out [resource]?"

**Day 4 (If still no response):**
- Automated value-add message
- Share related content or additional resource

**Day 7 (If still no response):**
- Automated final touchpoint
- "Last call" or "Still interested?" message
- Offer alternative ways to engage

**After Day 7:**

- No more automated DMs (avoid being spammy)
- Human can re-engage manually later

---

## Human Takeover Triggers

**When to have a human step in:**

1. **They ask a specific question** not covered by automation
2. **They express serious buying intent** ("How much is...?", "When can we start?")
3. **They mention a problem you can solve** specifically
4. **They've engaged 3+ times** with automated messages
5. **They've booked a call** (send personal confirmation)
6. **They mention competitors** or comparison shopping
7. **They express frustration or confusion**
8. **High-value prospect** (based on their profile)

**Notification Settings:**
- Alert team member immediately for high-priority takeovers
- Daily digest for moderate priority
- Track response time (goal: < 2 hours during business hours)

---

## ManyChat Setup Best Practices

### 1. Keyword Configuration
- **Case Insensitive:** Yes
- **Match Type:** Contains keyword (allows for "SEEDS please" to work)
- **Duplicate Prevention:** 24-hour cooldown per user per keyword
- **Testing:** Test each trigger before going live

### 2. Message Templates
- **Personalization:** Use {First Name} token
- **Emojis:** 2-3 per message (but not excessive)
- **Link Format:** Use shortened, trackable links
- **Character Limit:** Keep messages under 1000 characters
- **Button Options:** Use buttons for multi-choice responses

### 3. Compliance
- **Permission-Based:** Only DM people who commented
- **Opt-Out:** Include "Reply STOP to unsubscribe" in first message
- **Privacy:** Don't share or sell DM lists
- **Instagram Rules:** Follow Instagram's automation policies

### 4. Tracking & Analytics
- **Monitor Metrics:**
  - Trigger usage (which keywords are most popular)
  - Open rates (did they see the DM?)
  - Click rates (did they click the link?)
  - Response rates (did they engage back?)
  - Conversion rates (did they book a call or buy?)

- **Weekly Review:**
  - Top performing triggers
  - Drop-off points in sequences
  - Quality of leads generated
  - Adjustments needed

### 5. A/B Testing
**Test Variables:**
- Message length (short vs. detailed)
- Tone (formal vs. casual)
- Number of questions asked
- CTA placement
- Emoji usage
- Link vs. button

**Testing Process:**
- Run variation for 2 weeks
- Minimum 50 uses per variation
- Analyze conversion to next step
- Implement winner
