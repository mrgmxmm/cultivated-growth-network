## Carousel 1: "5 Trust Killers That Are Costing You Sales"

**Platform:** LinkedIn & Instagram
**Slides:** 6
**Goal:** Education + Engagement

### Slide 1 (Cover)
**Background:** CGN Green gradient
**Text:**
```
5 TRUST KILLERS
That Are Costing You Sales

(And How to Avoid Them)
```
**Visual:** Warning icon or broken handshake illustration

### Slide 2
**Background:** White with light green accent border
**Text:**
```
TRUST KILLER #1
Over-Promising

When you promise what you can't deliver,
you destroy credibility before you even start.

✓ Instead: Set realistic expectations and
over-deliver on results.
```

### Slide 3
**Background:** White with light green accent border
**Text:**
```
TRUST KILLER #2
Ignoring Red Flags

Pretending a prospect's concerns don't exist
won't make them buy.

✓ Instead: Address objections head-on with
empathy and evidence.
```

### Slide 4
**Background:** White with light green accent border
**Text:**
```
TRUST KILLER #3
Being Too Pushy

No one wants to feel manipulated into a decision.

✓ Instead: Guide prospects to make informed
decisions that serve their needs.
```

### Slide 5
**Background:** White with light green accent border
**Text:**
```
TRUST KILLER #4
Lack of Follow-Through

Every missed callback or delayed response
signals "You're not a priority."

✓ Instead: Do what you say you'll do,
when you say you'll do it.
```

### Slide 6
**Background:** White with light green accent border
**Text:**
```
TRUST KILLER #5
Making It All About You

Prospects don't care about your quota.
They care about solving their problems.

✓ Instead: Lead with their needs,
not your numbers.
```

## Carousel 2: "The 5x5 Prospecting Rule"

**Platform:** LinkedIn & Instagram
**Slides:** 7
**Goal:** Education + Lead Generation

### Slide 1 (Cover)
**Background:** CGN Yellow gradient
**Text:**
```
THE 5x5
PROSPECTING RULE

Fill Your Pipeline in 5 Days
```
**Visual:** Calendar or pipeline icon

### Slide 2
**Background:** White with yellow accent
**Text:**
```
THE PROBLEM

Most salespeople prospect sporadically—
a burst of activity, then nothing.

Result? An inconsistent,
unpredictable pipeline.
```

### Slide 3
**Background:** White with yellow accent
**Text:**
```
THE SOLUTION
5x5 Rule

5 new prospect touches
× 5 days per week
= 25 weekly touches

This creates predictable pipeline flow.
```

### Slide 4
**Background:** Light green with green text
**Text:**
```
WHAT COUNTS AS A TOUCH?

• Phone call (even if voicemail)
• Personalized email
• LinkedIn connection/message
• Direct mail or handwritten note
• Social media engagement
```

### Slide 5
**Background:** White with yellow accent
**Text:**
```
MULTI-CHANNEL MATTERS

Don't use the same channel 5 times.

✓ Mix it up: phone, email, LinkedIn,
video message, direct mail

People respond differently to
different channels.
```

### Slide 6
**Background:** White with yellow accent
**Text:**
```
THE MINDSET SHIFT

Prospecting isn't about closing deals.
It's about opening conversations.

Focus on consistency, not immediate results.
The harvest comes after planting.
```

## Carousel 3: "The Bridge Model™ for Discovery"

**Platform:** LinkedIn & Instagram
**Slides:** 6
**Goal:** Framework Education

### Slide 1 (Cover)
**Background:** CGN Green gradient
**Text:**
```
THE BRIDGE MODEL™

The Discovery Framework That
Closes More Deals
```
**Visual:** Bridge illustration connecting two sides

### Slide 2
**Background:** White
**Text:**
```
MOST DISCOVERY CALLS FAIL
BECAUSE...

Reps ask surface-level questions
and miss the real pain.

Without understanding the gap between
current state and desired state,
your solution is just a guess.
```

### Slide 3
**Background:** Light yellow
**Text:**
```
THE BRIDGE MODEL™

CURRENT STATE ——→ DESIRED STATE
        🌉 THE BRIDGE

The bridge is built by understanding:
• Obstacles in the way
• Impact of staying stuck
• Value of crossing over
```

### Slide 4
**Background:** White
**Text:**
```
STEP 1: CURRENT STATE

Ask questions like:
• "Walk me through your current process..."
• "What's working well right now?"
• "Where are you experiencing friction?"

Get specific. Paint the full picture.
```

### Slide 5
**Background:** White
**Text:**
```
STEP 2: DESIRED STATE

Ask questions like:
• "What would success look like?"
• "If you could wave a magic wand..."
• "In 12 months, what's different?"

This reveals their vision, not just pain points.
```

### Slide 6
**Background:** White
**Text:**
```
STEP 3: THE GAP

Identify obstacles:
• "What's preventing you from getting there?"

Calculate impact:
• "What's this costing you?" (time, money, stress)

Now your solution becomes THE BRIDGE.
```

### Slide 7 (CTA)

## Carousel 4: "7 Signs You're in Seed Stage (Not Growth Stage)"

**Platform:** Instagram & LinkedIn
**Slides:** 7
**Goal:** Self-Assessment + Engagement

### Slide 1 (Cover)
**Background:** CGN Yellow gradient
**Text:**
```
7 SIGNS YOU'RE IN
SEED STAGE

(Not Growth Stage)

It's okay—every expert started here.
```

### Slide 2
**Background:** White with light yellow border
**Text:**
```
SIGN #1

You wing it on every sales call.

No script, no process, no consistency.
Every conversation is different.

Seed Stage = No repeatable system yet.
```

### Slide 3
**Background:** White with light yellow border
**Text:**
```
SIGN #2

You avoid prospecting because
you're not sure what to say.

Fear of rejection keeps you from
filling your pipeline.

Growth requires consistent planting.
```

### Slide 4
**Background:** White with light yellow border
**Text:**
```
SIGN #3

You can't explain why deals close
(or why they don't).

Success feels random, not predictable.

You need to identify your winning formula.
```

### Slide 5
**Background:** White with light yellow border
**Text:**
```
SIGN #4

Discovery calls turn into
awkward interrogations.

You ask questions but don't know
how to use the answers.

Effective discovery is a learned skill.
```

### Slide 6
**Background:** White with light yellow border
**Text:**
```
SIGN #5

Objections catch you off-guard
every time.

You fumble through responses because
you haven't prepared.

Objections are predictable—
your responses should be too.
```

### Slide 7
**Background:** White with light yellow border
**Text:**
```
SIGN #6

You have no follow-up system.

Deals slip through the cracks because
there's no process for staying in touch.

Growth requires systems.
```

**Text:**
```
YOUR PIPELINE
IS DYING

5 Reasons Why
(And How to Fix It)
```

### Slide 2
**Background:** White with red accent
**Text:**
```
REASON #1
You're Not Prospecting Consistently

Inconsistent activity =
Feast or famine cycles

FIX: The 5x5 Rule
5 touches × 5 days = Predictable pipeline
```

### Slide 3
**Background:** White with red accent
**Text:**
```
REASON #2
You're Chasing Unqualified Leads

FIX: Qualify early, disqualify fast
```

### Slide 4
**Background:** White with red accent
**Text:**
```
REASON #3
Your Follow-Up is Weak

One email and you're done?
Most deals close after 5-7 touches.

FIX: Build a follow-up sequence
Mix channels, add value each time
```

### Slide 5
**Background:** White with red accent
**Text:**
```
REASON #4
You're Skipping Discovery

Jumping to pitch mode without
understanding their real needs

FIX: Use The Bridge Model™

THE RETENTION STRATEGY
You're Ignoring

(It costs 5x more to acquire
than to retain)
```

### Slide 2
**Background:** White
**Text:**

THE PROBLEM

You work so hard to close the deal,
